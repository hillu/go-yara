# Repackaged go-yara

This package is a repackaged version of
https://github.com/hillu/go-yara which focuses on making it easier to
use.

Instead of requiring users to install the yara library on the build
system, this package already includes the library within it.  This
makes it very easy to use - simply add the dependency and build
normally.

The resulting binary will also be statically built and have no
external shared object dependencies. No need to mess with build flags:

```
~/go/src/github.com/Velocidex/go-yara$ go build _examples/simple-yara/simple-yara.go
~/go/src/github.com/Velocidex/go-yara$ ldd simple-yara
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd4085a000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fcd9867c000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fcd9828b000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fcd9889b000)
```

To build for windows, there is no need to build the yara library
first, just build your project with the usual steps:
```
~/go/src/github.com/Velocidex/go-yara$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 \
      CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
      go build _examples/simple-yara/simple-yara.go
```

Go bindings for [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), staying as
close as sensible to the library's C-API while taking inspiration from
the `yara-python` implementation.

## Installation

### Unix

On a Unix system with _libyara_, its header files, and _pkg-config_
installed, the following should simply work, provided that `GOPATH` is
set:

```
go get github.com/hillu/go-yara
go install github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

The _pkg-config_ program should be able to output the correct compiler
and linker flags from the `yara.pc` file that has been generated and
installed by _YARA_'s build system. If _libyara_ has been installed to
a custom location, the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable can be
used to point _pkg-config_ at the right `yara.pc` file. If
_pkg-config_ cannot be used at all, please see "Build Tags" below.

Linker errors in the compiler output such as

    undefined reference to `yr_compiler_add_file'

indicate that the linker is probably looking at an old version of
_libyara_.

### Cross-building for Windows

_go-yara_ can be cross-built on a current Debian system using the
MinGW cross compiler (_gcc-mingw-w64_) if the Go compiler contains
Windows runtime libraries with CGO support
([cf.](https://github.com/hillu/golang-go-cross)). After _libyara_ has
been built from the source tree with the MinGW compiler using the
usual `./configure && make && make install`, _go-yara_ can be built
and installed. Some environment variables need to be set when running
`go build` or `go install`:

- `GOOS`, `GOARCH` indicate the cross compilation target.
- `CGO_ENABLED` is set to 1 beacuse it defaults to 0 when
  cross-compiling.
- `CC` has to specified because the _go_ tool has no knowledge on what
  C compiler to use (it defaults to the system C compiler, usually
  gcc).
- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is set so the _go_ tool can determine correct
  locations for headers and libraries through _pkg-config_.

32bit:

```
$ cd ${YARA_SRC} \
  && ./bootstrap.sh \
  && ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-magic --disable-cuckoo --without-crypto --prefix=${YARA_SRC}/i686-w64-mingw32 \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} install
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 \
  CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${YARA_SRC}/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig \
  go install -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"' github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

  && ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-magic --disable-cuckoo --without-crypto --prefix=${YARA_SRC}/x86_64-w64-mingw32 \

  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} install
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 \

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${YARA_SRC}/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig \
  go install -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"' github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

## Build Tags

_go-yara_ is tested with the latest stable version of YARA, currently
3.7. If you need to to build with an older version of YARA, certain
features that are not present in older versions can be excluded by
passing a build tag such as `yara3.3`, `yara3.4`, `yara3.5`. If you
want to build with a git snapshot of YARA, you may use a build tag
corresponding to the upcoming stable YARA version, currently
`yara3.8`. You also need to pass the tag when you build your own
project.

The build tag `yara_static` can be used to tell the Go toolchain to
run _pkg-config_ with the `--static` switch.

The build tag `no_pkg_config` can be used to tell the Go toolchain not
to use _pkg-config_'s output. In this case, any compiler or linker
flags have to be set via the `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS`
environment variables, e.g.:

```
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I${YARA_SRC}/libyara/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${YARA_SRC}/libyara/.libs -lyara"
go install -tags no_pkg_config github.com/hillu/go-yara
```
